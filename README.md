# Linear_Regression

# Overview

Linear regression is a fundamental technique in machine learning and statistics used to understand and predict the relationship between two variables: one independent variable and one dependent variable. This method helps in determining how changes in the independent variable affect the dependent variable by fitting a line that best minimizes the difference between observed data and predicted data.

# When to Use Linear Regression

To determine if linear regression is suitable for your problem, follow these steps:

Find the Relationship Between Variables: Investigate the relationship between your independent and dependent variables.

Check for Linearity: If there is a linear relationship, linear regression can be an appropriate method.

Plotting and Analysis: Visualize the data to identify any linear trends.

Correlation Analysis: Perform correlation analysis to determine if there is a linear correlation between the variables.

# Assumptions of Linear Regression

For linear regression to be effective, certain assumptions must be met:

Linearity: There must be a linear relationship between the independent and dependent variables.

Independence: Data points should be independent of each other. In time series predictions, errors or residuals over time should not affect each other.

Homoscedasticity: The spread of the errors or variance should be consistent for all independent values.

No Autocorrelation: There should be no correlation between the residuals.
